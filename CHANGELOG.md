# Changelog

All notable changes to Helix Workspace are documented here. This file follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Local startup supports rrule's CommonJS export and existing Meilisearch indexes;
  mail retention uses the database clock for its default cutoff.
- Fresh demo setup supplies current identity, Calendar, Chat, and Mail delivery
  fields, creates the tenant before its users, and verifies the actual login handler.

## [1.0.0-rc.1] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- Release scope, licensing, release checklist, and a workflow for RC drafts and
  evidence-gated final release drafts.
- Production CSP with isolated mail rendering, configured Jitsi origins, and an
  external appearance bootstrap.
- Full PostgreSQL/RLS and RustFS CI suites with unexpected-skip rejection, plus
  generated route freshness verification.

### Changed

- Drive stores, shares, and downloads files without document editors or converters.
- The invite-only 1.0 profile includes Mail, Drive, Chat, Assistant, and Admin.
  Calendar and Meet remain dormant implementations outside that release claim.
- Hardened tenant isolation, authentication, administration, mail delivery,
  storage, dependency images, and release evidence binding.
- Split server startup, Drive/Mail stores, database schemas, and web shells;
  centralized shared helpers and enforce formatting, file-size, and dependency gates.

### Removed

- Editors, editor integrations and search types, public signup stubs, and the
  installable plugin runtime. Built-in webhook formatters remain available.
- Duplicate icons, obsolete dependencies, production test fixtures, and tracked
  screenshots of retired features.

### Fixed

- Mail threading and mailbox visibility use canonical recipient deliveries;
  Calendar invitations create mail threads instead of reusing event threads.
- Domain capabilities use canonical ownership challenges and reject foreign
  claims; tenant constraints preserve actor rules and couple newly added references.
- WebDAV records the correct audiences for uploads, moves, and deletions.
  Raw mail evidence remains immutable, and Mail/Meet attachments retain snapshots.
- Outbound mail no longer strands a leased send silently; failures include
  actionable diagnostics and the runbook covers stuck queues.
- Core-app status respects `HELIX_APPS`, and cross-tenant checks execute their
  complete live database suite.

This initial changelog is seeded from the integration milestone `9b3f6cd` and
its preceding readiness work (`29b1575`, `bfd4e3c`, `10a4377`, `546b1e3`, and
`aad4592`). Package version `1.0.0` is not a release claim; no GA is recorded
until its signed tag and complete final evidence packet exist.
